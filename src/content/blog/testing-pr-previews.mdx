This is a test blog post created to verify that PR preview functionality is working correctly! 🎉

## What We're Testing

This post helps verify that:

- Navigation links work correctly in PR previews
- Blog post links stay within the preview environment
- Images load from the correct base path
- The active link highlighting works with dynamic base paths

## How It Works

When you're viewing this in a PR preview, the site is served from a path like `/preview/pr-123/`. All the links on this page should include that prefix, keeping you inside the preview environment.

### Navigation Test

Try clicking on the navigation links in the header:
- **Home** - Should take you to `/preview/pr-123/`
- **Resume** - Should take you to `/preview/pr-123/resume`
- **Blog** - Should take you to `/preview/pr-123/blog`

None of these should redirect you to the production site!

### Blog Links Test

Go back to the blog listing page and click on different blog posts. Each should stay within the preview environment.

### Image Test

If you can see the hero image and the profile picture on the home page, then image paths are working correctly with the base path.

## The Solution

We created a `getUrl()` helper function that automatically prepends the configured `BASE_URL` to all internal links. This means:

```typescript
// Production (BASE_URL = "/")
getUrl("/blog") // Returns: "/blog"

// PR Preview (BASE_URL = "/preview/pr-123")
getUrl("/blog") // Returns: "/preview/pr-123/blog"
```

Pretty neat! ✨

## Updated Files

The fix required updating:
- URL helper utility (`src/utils/url.ts`)
- Navigation components
- Blog post card components
- Footer links
- Asset paths (images, favicon)
- RSS feed generation

## Conclusion

If you can read this post in a PR preview and all the links work correctly, then our implementation is successful! Time to merge this to production.

Happy testing! 🚀
