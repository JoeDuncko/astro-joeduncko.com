I had the opportunity to share [SWBF2.events](https://swbf2.events/), one of my side projects, at [Code Youngstown's annual Lightning Talk event at Westside Bowl on August 24th, 2021](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Youngstown/events/279804695/).

SWBF2.events is a tiny progressive web app (PWA) that displays current and upcoming community events in EA Star Wars Battlefront II (2017).

The talk, embedded below, below details some background and motivations, how the site was built, and how I grew the app to over 3,500 unique visitors a month.
