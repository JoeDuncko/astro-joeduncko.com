This is an update to [a medium post I made in 2018](https://medium.com/@JoeDuncko/my-macos-set-up-8f2acbc2683f) documenting the settings I usually change when I set up a fresh macOS installation.

This is mostly for myself, and to share with people who get their first Mac.

This guide was most recently updated 2024-01-15 with macOS 14.2.1.

## Desktop

### Turn on Dark Mode

In Settings, under Appearance, Select `Dark` mode.

### Turn on Night Shift

In Settings, under Displays, choose `Night Shift`. Set `Schedule` to `Sunset to Sunrise` and turn `Color Temperature` up all the way.

### Display Seconds in Menu Bar

  alt={"Joe's Display Time with Seconds settings"}
/>

In Settings, search the word `seconds`. Select `Display the time with seconds in the menu bar`. Turn `Display the time with seconds` to `On`.

## Set up Dock

In Settings, under Desktop and Dock...

### Under Dock

- Slide `Size` to ~20%
- Slide `Magnification` to ~30%
- Set `Position on Screen` to `Left`
- Switch `Minimize windows into application icon` to `On`
- Switch `Automatically hide and show the dock` to `Off`
- Switch `Show indicators for open applications` to `On`
- Switch `Show suggested and recent apps in Dock` to `Off`

### Under Desktop and Stage Manager

<img

  alt={"Joe's Desktop and Stage Manager settings"}
/>

- Switch `Stage Manager` to `Off`

### Under Mission control

  alt={"Joe's Mission Control settings"}
/>

This is the stuff that makes using the Mac's multiple desktop features feel really good.

- Switch `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use` to `Off`
- Switch `When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application` to `Off`
- Switch `Group windows by application` to `Off`
- Switch `Displays have separate spaces` to `On`

## Finder

<img

  alt={"Joe's General Finder settings"}
/>

In File > Settings, under General, uncheck showing any items on desktop.

<img
  src="/images/joes-macos-configuration/finder-settings-sidebar.png"
  alt={"Joe's Sidebar Finder settings"}
/>

In File > Settings, under Sidebar, check all items under `Favorites` and `Locations`. I personally also disable the `Recent tags` function, as I don't use them.

<img
  src="/images/joes-macos-configuration/finder-settings-advanced.png"
  alt={"Joe's Advanced Finder settings"}
/>

In File > Settings, under Advanced, checkmark `Show all filename extensions` and both options for `Keep folders on top`.

<img
  src="/images/joes-macos-configuration/finder-view-settings.png"
  alt={"Joe's Finder View settings"}
/>

In View, select to Show Toolbar, Show Path Bar, and Show Status Bar.

<img
  src="/images/joes-macos-configuration/finder-view-options.png"
  alt={"Joe's Finder View Options settings"}
/>

While in any folder besides Recents, in View > Show View Options, set `Sort By` to `name`, then at the bottom click `Use as Defaults`.

## Keyboard

### Keyboard Layout - Colemak

In Settings, under Keyboard, under Text Input, click `Edit...`.

Then click the `+` button at the bottom left.

Under `English`, select `Colemak`. Click `Save`.

### Touch bar

In Settings, under Keyboard, click `Touch Bar Settings...`.

Set `Touch Bar shows` to `Expanded Control Strip`.

Then, click `Customize Control Strip`. See my configuration below. Note the leftmost button is the `Input Sources` touch key.

## Mail

<img

  alt={"Joe's Mail Spelling and Grammar Options settings"}
/>

While in Mail, go to `Edit`, then under `Spelling and Grammar` uncheck `Correct Spelling Automatically`

## Screenshots

```
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location [folder location here]
```
