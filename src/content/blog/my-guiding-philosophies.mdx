I was recently reminded of the Organization Values Andrew Jarvis, Chris Palmer, and I came up with during the time we were working on our startup.

For being written more than 5 years ago, I was surprised to find that the content documentat I dug up continued to feel representative of the philosophies with which I carry out my work today.

Below is a polished up version of that document, with commentary.

## Do everything in iterations

_Nothing is perfect the first time, don't expect it to be._

Work in vertical slices, delivering value (and code) in small, consistent chunks.

## Do the easy thing before doing the hard thing

80/20, something "good enough" iteration may be all you need - and if it's not, you'll prove it's worth spending additonal resources on. It's win win.

## Choose automation over processes

_Automation allows us to focus on more interesting problems._

## If you can't automate a process, at least make it predictable

## Transparency

_Few private conversations, no private work, no private code._

Ideally, Nothing should ever need to be "shared" or "published" for the group - the progress should be internally public from inception. Keeps everyone honest, keeps everyone on the same page, reduces bus factor

## Document everything

_With the goal of allowing others to pick up where you left off._


prefer things that are self documenting (variable names, types, automated workflows), reduces bus factor, forces you to write code that doesn't just work but that others (and future you) can read and edit
